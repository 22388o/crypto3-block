# Introduction

The Crypto3.Block library extends the Nil Foundation's cryptography suite and provides a set of block ciphers
 implemented in way C++ standard library implies: concepts, algorithms, predictable behavior, latest standard features
  support and clean architecture without compromising security and performance.
  
  Crypto3.Block consists of several parts to review:
  * Algorithms.
  * Architecture.
  * Concepts.
  * Interface.
  
  A small part of each topic is reviewed right at introduction, but the detailed information is recommended to look
   inside of a corresponding chapter.
